# Tiny-Faces-Detection-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN-
This is a face detection model that has the ability to detect faces of different scales and sizes. It has been trained using a Multi-Branch Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) and an adapted Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
